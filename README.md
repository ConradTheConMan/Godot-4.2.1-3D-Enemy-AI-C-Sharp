# Godot-4.2.1-3D-Enemy-AI-C-Sharp
This is a C# solution to enemy AI in Godot 4.2.1 for a CharacterBody3D. This AI is very simple and does not have an attack function. 
I made this because I could not find a solution for a 3D AI for Godot 4.2.1 using C#.
If you wish to use this ensure your enemy matches the scheme as seen in enemy1.png.
You must also have a player character with a Camera3D as a child.
Also ensure that the Area3Ds and timer have been linked to the enemy.
A navmesh and waypoints must also be present.
It is unlikely I will check pull requests or bug reports for a long time. This is just meant to work for now, not be perfect.
If you have suggestions or feedback, please leave it in discussions.
