# Godot-4.2.1-Enemy-AI-C-
This is a C# solution to enemy AI in Godot 4.2.1 for a CharacterBody3D. This AI is very simple and does not have an attack function. 
I made this because I could not find a solution for a 3D AI for Godot 4.2.1 using C#.
If you wish to use this ensure your enemy matches the scheme as seen in enemy1.png.
